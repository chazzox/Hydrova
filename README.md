## About
- This repo is currently in active development, expect things to not work, features to be changed and settings to be rewritten.
- I'm currently taking a break from this project to write a libary for rendering tree data structures (i wonder what it could be useful for...)
- If anyone wants to get involved in this project feel free to shoot me a dm on discord or twitter!
